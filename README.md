# colias-gea

Code and workflow for bioinformatic processing and statistical analyses for the population genomic analysis of clouded sulfur butterflies (_Colias philodice eriphyle_) in Colorado and Wyoming, USA.

#### Workflow
1. Processing raw FASTQ files
2. Variant calling: ANGSD (preliminary)
3. Variant calling: GATK4 (used in manuscript)
4. Genetic diversity analysis
5. Isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis
6. Genotype-environment association -- redundancy analysis (RDA)

**Acknowledgement for computing:** All bioinformatic processing and analyses were completed using the RMACC Alpine computing cluster managed by Colorado State University and University of Colorado, Boulder.
